# 10-6. Addition: One common problem when prompting for numerical input 
# occurs when people provide text instead of numbers. When you try to convert 
# the input to an int, youâ€™ll get a TypeError. Write a program that prompts for 
# two numbers. Add them together and print the result. Catch the TypeError if 
# either input value is not a number, and print a friendly error message. Test your 
# program by entering two numbers and then by entering some text instead of a 
# number

try:
    prompt = "Enter number: "
    first_number = int(input(prompt))
    second_number = int(input(prompt))
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid literal, please enter a number")
else:
    result = first_number + second_number
    print(result)

# 10-7. Addition Calculator: Wrap your code from Exercise 10-6 in a while loop 
# so the user can continue entering numbers even if they make a mistake and 
# enter text instead of a number
    
# while True:
#     try:
#         prompt = "Enter number: "
#         first_number = int(input(prompt))

#     except ValueError:
#         print("Invalid literal, please enter a number")

#         result = first_number + second_number
#         print(result)
